        <h1>Advanced Restaurant OCR Technology</h1>
        <p>Standard Optical Character Recognition fails when faced with the creative and complex layouts of modern restaurant menus. Ashnora has built a proprietary OCR engine trained specifically on restaurant data.</p>

        <div className="flex gap-4 my-8 not-prose">
          <Button size="lg" onClick={() => navigate('/login')}>Get Started Free</Button>

        </div>

        <h2>Understanding Context</h2>
        <p>Our OCR doesn't just read words; it understands what those words mean. It knows the difference between a sub-heading ("Appetizers"), a dish name ("Crispy Calamari"), a description ("Served with marinara sauce"), and a price ("$12.99").</p>
        <h2>Handling Complex Layouts</h2>
        <p>Whether your menu is laid out in columns, uses intricate typography, or features overlapping text and images, our engine can parse the structure accurately and reconstruct it digitally.</p>
        <h2>Continuous Learning</h2>
        <p>Our AI is constantly learning. Every menu scanned improves the system's accuracy, meaning Ashnora's OCR gets faster and smarter every single day.</p>
